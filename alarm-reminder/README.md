# Alarm Reminder

This script will send emails to the configured adress, reminding the user about a alarm. The user can configure how often emails will be sent.

The emails will be sent if there's an active alarm that has **not** been acknowledged yet and/or if there's an alarm that has been reset and **not** acknowledged.
